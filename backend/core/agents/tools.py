CartGenie AI Agent Tools

This module provides tools for CrewAI agents to interact with external systems:
- Vector database search for product similarity matching
- Web scraping for real-time price data
- Knowledge graph queries for historical price information

The tools integrate with sponsor technologies:
- Superlinked: For generating product embeddings (placeholder implementation)
- Cognee: For extracting structured product data from HTML (placeholder implementation)
- Zyte: For geolocation-aware web scraping
